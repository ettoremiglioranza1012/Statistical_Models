# Statical Models Reports

Two significant case studies of applied statistics modelling in healthcare.

- Case study 1 - An interesting example of statistical modeling, where I used basic classifiers (logistic regression, KNN) and tackled the class imbalance problem using SMOTE, an advanced synthetic data generation method.
- Case study 2 - Here three regression models — a cost-complexity pruned decision tree, a random forest, and a gradient boosting model — were developed to predict the progression of diabetes based on clinical predictors.
